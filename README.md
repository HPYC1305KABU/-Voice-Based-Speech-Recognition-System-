# -Voice-Based-Speech-Recognition-System-

Overview of the project : The voice of human speech is an effective communication method consisting of unique semantic linguistic and paralinguistic features such as gender, age, language, accent, and emotional state. The sound waves consisting of human voice are unique among all creatures producing sound since every single wave carries a different frequency. Identifying human based on voice has been a challenging task for voice and sound analysts who deploy numerous applications including (i) effective advertising and marketing strategies in customer relationship management (CRM) systems which depend on gender interoperability such as the user interface style as well as preferences of words and colors; (ii) investigating criminal voice in crime scenarios; and (iii) enhancing human-computer interaction (HCI) systems especially dialogue systems by customizing services that rely on gender voice and also improving the level of user satisfaction.

Descriptive analytics (Methodology):  The proposed methodology for speech gender classification includes a set of stages as briefly discussed.
The stages start by converting the voice, from its abstract representation, into a consistent form in order to extract the relevant features. Then, the relevant features are selected as inputs for building a classifier model for recognizing a human voice. In addition, a DL model is being built to automatically extract useful features and feed them into a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN) for classification.
